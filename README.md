## Markov Chain Trading Algorithm

This repository contains a Markov chain-based trading algorithm. The algorithm uses a trained Markov model to generate trading signals, which are then used to execute trades on a live market.

The algorithm is trained on historical data, which includes market prices and other relevant factors. The algorithm learns the relationships between these factors and uses this knowledge to predict future market movements.

The algorithm can be used to trade any asset, including stocks, currencies, and commodities. It can also be used to trade on any time frame, from intraday to long-term.

**Features**

* Trained on historical data to learn the relationships between market factors
* Generates trading signals based on predicted future market movements
* Can be used to trade any asset on any time frame
* Easy to use and implement

**Requirements**

* Python 3.6 or higher
* numpy
* pandas
* scikit-learn

**Instructions**

To use the algorithm, simply clone the repository to your local machine and install the required dependencies. Then, create a new Python file and import the `marcov_trader` module.

Next, create a new instance of the `MarkovTrader` class and pass in the historical data for the asset you want to trade. Finally, call the `generate_signals()` method to generate trading signals.

The trading signals can then be used to execute trades on a live market. For example, you could use the signals to open and close positions, or to enter and exit orders.

**Disclaimer**

This algorithm is for educational purposes only and should not be used to trade real money without proper risk management.
